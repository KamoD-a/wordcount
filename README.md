# wordcount
A simple Dataview.js Query that will display the wordcount taken from the Daily Notes.

# Prerequisites:
- Daily Notes (Core Plugin)
- Dataview (Community Plugin)
- Obsidian Charts (Community Plugin)

# Usage:
Create a Daily Note and enter the total word count of the project. Also enter which wordgoal you want to have by now.
### Example:
It is the fifth day of your writing project. You want to have written 2.500 words by now and you have written 2.700 words in total. This is what you have to write in your Daily Note:
- wordcount::2700
- wordgoal::2500
Yes, currently you have to update it manually. But it's only two numbers :)

# Daily Notes Template:
- wordcount::0
- wordgoal::500

# Graph:
You can put the graph code where ever you want to display your chart. Make sure to update your path to the file or folder where you have your Daily Notes. Mine is in Util/Daily Notes.

# Acknockledgements:
This project would not have been possible without the amazing website obsidian.rocks and the article https://obsidian.rocks/creating-dynamic-graphs-in-obsidian/ from Tim Miller.
